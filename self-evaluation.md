# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

I feel confident with my understanding of the `each` method and middling confident with my fluency. I need some more practice.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

That felt like a fun time. I didn't really realize that was the case in the moment. But I did have to do more problem solving. Huh. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to practice the methods I learned while doing the practice challenges for the iteration lesson. I'll just create new arrays and use the same methods to iterate slightly different things. I don't need to adjust my calendar. I have an hour tomorrow that I will block off. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't actually have any unresolved questions. I just resolved the last one.
